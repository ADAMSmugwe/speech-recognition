# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Project Overview

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition system using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Deep Learning. The goal is to classify emotions from speech audio data by extracting acoustic features and training neural networks to recognize emotional patterns.
